## Introduction
There's a time when we listen a song, and the only thing that can be said is, "This is a hit"! What truly attracts us to certain sounds, and gets us hooked immediately? We'll take a deep dive into a vast collection of songs on Spotify, look at the songs' attributes, and find correlation of those attributes to the songs' popularity.

## What's in the Data?
This dataset contains a collection of 174,389 songs from the Spotify API that a user on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks), with publishing spanning from 1920 to 2021. We'll focus on a subset of the data that spans from 2000 to 2021, narrowing it down to 40,531 songs, and keeping our analysis spotlight on modernity. Each row represents a song and its features. We'll define the features of focus, and what each of them means and represents further down. All of this data is in a CSV file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I created a subset of the data to keep it relevant to current trends from the year 2000 to 2021. I cleaned it up to only analyze my columns of interest, which are:<br>

[Popularity]()

[Danceability]()

[Energy]()

[Instrumentalness]()

[Speechiness]()

[Explicit]()

[Mode]()

I then sorted the data by *Popularity* in ascending order from **30** to **100**, dropping it down to **22,030 rows x 9 columns**.
